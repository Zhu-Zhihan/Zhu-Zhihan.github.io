## Work Experience
2021.7-2022.6(expected)&emsp;Research Assistant in School of Mathematics, Beihang University  
- Supervisor: Prof. Yong Xia
- Research on HBF high-precision channel reconstruction. At present, there is a preliminary technical route. It is planned to use regularized least squares model and manifold optimization, robust optimization and other algorithms for program design
- The expected goal is that the error between the reconstructed channel and the real channel is less than -20dB, and the complexity of the algorithm is no more than an order of magnitude higher than the current channel estimation algorithm

## Projects
- Super-resolution parameter estimation and completion of 5.5G massive MIMO communication system, National Science and Technology Key R&D Program "Mathematics and Applied Research" Key Special Project, 2022/01-2025/12(expected), 12 million, participant  
- Non-convex optimization, National Natural Science Foundation of China Outstanding Youth Science Fund Project, 2019/01-2021/12, 1.3 million, participant  

## Research Experience
Computational Research on a New Type of Grӧbner Bases, Project Team Leader, 2018.3-2021.5  
- School of Mathematics, Beihang University
- Supervisor: Associate Prof. Shengming Ma
- Obtained research funding of 5,000 yuan by the scientific and technological innovation project of Beihang University
- Organized a seminar on computational algebraic geometry within the college, up to 32 hours in the semester
- Verified a new mathematical definition, which is the Grӧbner bases on the principal ideal quotient rings, and discovered its excellent properties
- Utilized pseudo-divisions over principal ideal rings, instead of divisions over fields, to improve the classic Buchberger algorithm, which optimized the efficiency of the algorithm and the complexity of the intermediate expression by at least an order of magnitude
- Implemented a new algorithm in engineering using Maple language, and wrote a graduation thesis  

Anti- CAPTCHA Malicious Identification Method Based on Adversarial Learning, Project Team Member, 2018.12-2019.4
- School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University
- Supervisor: Associate Prof. Jianlei Yang
